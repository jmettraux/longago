## Lesson 2025-03-28

Here’s today’s game against John.  Unfortunately, I had 3 updates and one of them knocked out the audio (I’m looking at you OBS).  I was informed by chat, so found the issue after the game (hopefully ok for tonight’s game).

A standard opening, so no indication of the messiness to come (for both of us).

![dia 2](images/l20250328/igo2.jpg)

Unfortunately, right out of the gate, a cap to block the center, this early, seemed a poor choice.   After corners, something on the side seems better, expanding your group and restricting white.

W1 looks like it has better connectivity, than the b2 response, an issue playing in the middle of the board.  W3 was free to expand the side, then b4 and b6 helped black out in the center.

![dia 4](images/l20250328/igo4.jpg)

W1 naturally jumps out, so b2 threatens to push through.  Unfortunately, b4 is the wrong response to w3, and black lost the corner.

![dia 5](images/l20250328/igo5.jpg)

The corner is the priority, so just connect solidly.  There is no viable cut for w3, so it didn’t need to be protected.

![dia 6](images/l20250328/igo6.jpg)

After I jumped at the bottom to give my vulnerable group more space, black added another stone to the blockade of the top.  Seeing the potential for a huge pocket, white jumps in 4th line for better access to the center vs 3rd line for better eye making space on the side (miscalculation?).   As black comes out from the right, white will push to the right, putting defensive pressure on black’s vulnerable group.  Fingers crossed the invasion works!

![dia 7](images/l20250328/igo7.jpg)

Jumping straight out here gives white potential threats in the future.  In the top left, white does a Keima jump, which is less problematic.  A Keima jump by black would also be one space closer to the single white stone.

![dia 8](images/l20250328/igo8.jpg)

White responds diagonally, black Keima jumps, so white jumps.  Black makes white heavy, which also helps with black’s connectivity.  The move to undercut white’s group looks good.

![dia 9](images/l20250328/igo9.jpg)

When white switched to ‘create a base’ mode for the invasion, b1 to undercut that idea with a monkey jump threat would be good timing.  Black has good blocking from the top and up from the bottom right, although white does have a slide.  However, the drop down does have a second purpose.

![dia 10](images/l20250328/igo10.jpg)

Black went to protect the top side and made white even heavier, so b1 was again a good eye threat.  If/when white jumps out, black just follows

![dia 11](images/l20250328/igo11.jpg)

Black attacked my loose connection, which split my groups.  He has a living shape at the bottom and I’m ok on the left, but the bottom right is vulnerable and the right has just one eye and escape blocked.  If it can play 2 moves, it’ll have 2 eyes.  However, if I play to make eyes, black with stop me from 2, so I need to play it so it doesn’t look like an eye making move, therefore attack from the other side!

![dia 12](images/l20250328/igo12.jpg)

Now it’s going to be cut off, so it will also be thinking about life.

![dia 13](images/l20250328/igo13.jpg)

After being cut off, b1 attacks, as this group is still vulnerable.  Then, b3 attacks the other group, so I jump into the open space (perhaps I can find a 2nd eye).  Also, if I live, reducing the center was my original purpose.  Putting more stones into an enclosed space held by black won’t put affect my score negatively.

![dia 14](images/l20250328/igo14.jpg)

White tries to wiggle free, but that loose black wall holds.  Also, we’re getting close to ‘will negatively affect me’ territory, plus black can make this a false eye with one move.

![dia 15](images/l20250328/igo15.jpg)

W1 gets blocked by b2 creating 2 double Atari with my next move.  I can make a 2nd eye here (relief).

![dia 16](images/l20250328/igo16.jpg)

With a 2nd eye, white could push into the center from the open left side, which cut off black’s group, which had to fight for eyes.  Unfortunately, time management issues meant black missed a basic protective move in the surrounded lower right.  I blame it on that 90 degree jump structure, that was not reinforced, allowing it to be cut off.

## Lesson 2024-12-20

Before the match, we had talked about John deviating from our standard openings next week, but he jumped the gun and didn’t approach my upper left corner in today’s game.

I, of course, enclosed high, as that worked well with my mid point extension.  B2 was a good point on the left side, so I blocked with a Keima.  B2 was good because it had an extension on either side, Miai to whichever side I would play.  Instead, b4 jumped out.

I returned to ‘approach the corners’ Go in the lower right, which gave black Sente, which he used to jump out at the bottom.  This gave me the chance to steal his base on the left.

Had b1 taken a base, white would have responded by jumping out, to which black could then have jumped out (either here or at his j5).

After black jumped out again on the left, white invaded at r8, the lower of the midpoints of the 3 space Ogeima.  We exchanged some stones then black leaves the battle to invade.  White’s 3 stones on the right are still vulnerable, so this is a good time to put pressure on the bottom 3 stones.  Black has j5 in place and stones jutting out from the right, leaving white with little access to the center.  Dropping down at b1 would be a good place to start.  If white runs, then the right side can follow and put white’s other group in peril.

As for black’s invasion, it’s probably too deep, considering it’s behind 2 sector lines.  One line higher puts it on the sector line, which is much safer.

![dia 7](images/l20241220/igo7.jpg)

Here we see a defensive move for a situation that is seen as the opposite of what it is.  White is the one with a weak group and a weakish group, so black should be putting pressure on white, not feeling pressure from white.  The drop down to r2 is both offensive and defensive.  Besides that, black has left the battle again.

![dia 8](images/l20241220/igo8.jpg)

Black should be able to pull his stones out of the fire (unless he allows white to block his escape route).

![dia 9](images/l20241220/igo9.jpg)

White felt the need to attend to his weak group, so attached to the black stone, then wrapped around the top.  Black got in a cut, so white had to push him into the center.  White’s goal is to escape into the center, as he doesn’t have eye space yet.

![dia 10](images/l20241220/igo10.jpg)

I would have liked to have seen black turn at b1 to put pressure on the white group.  After w6, black would need to switch to using the corner group to apply pressure, perhaps at n5.

![dia 11](images/l20241220/igo11.jpg)

Instead, there’s a different exchange, then black doesn’t connect solidly, instead leaving an Atari behind.

![dia 12](images/l20241220/igo12.jpg)

Here is another unnecessary move that (further) secures something that isn’t under attack and can’t be.  Instead, a reduction move from the right into the belly of my pocket or a move on the left to help establish a pocket for that nice wall of black stones.  Also, the stones at the top haven’t been cut off yet.

![dia 13](images/l20241220/igo13.jpg)

White finally gets around to sealing in the 2 black stones at the top and jumping out from the left to destroy the potential for a significant pocket for black.  Black has a nice Y shaped string, but isn’t making any profit from those stones.

![dia 14](images/l20241220/igo14.jpg)

Here is another case of unnecessary defensive move, when you need a move to negate some of your opponent’s profit.

![dia 15](images/l20241220/igo15.jpg)

Just extending with b1 gives black lots of room to move within white’s pocket.  And the cut that black feared is just run to ground.

Not quite as good as the last two games, but fluctuations are to be expected.

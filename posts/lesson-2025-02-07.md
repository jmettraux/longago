Short and sweet with a bit of fighting!

Standard opening sequences, except my approach in the lower right was a bit cramped.  That, of course, should be a target for black to pressure.

John restricted the base for my weakest group, then extended his group on the left with a keima to the 2nd line (rather than just extend on the 3rd line).  He jumped out from the right and I responded to all.  My weakest group has its nose out into the center, but could still be pressured from either side.  When John jumps out at the top, the open space in between becomes interesting for white.

First things first, so white jumps out from the left, as being restricted puts pressure on your group, plus your opponent gets potential behind his line of enclosure. C8 is interesting to white to open up his position, but it’s not a priority for black.  Tying the right side together before white does something there is more important.

W2 strengthens the position and gives black a choice of sides.  Black defends the bottom and it is now basically secure.  The top also has good structure, so can also be called secure.  Realistically, black can focus elsewhere.  Any responses to white in the area should be to keep that security.

B2 is moving to keep white separated, so white needs to keep his weak bottom group safe.  Black is also looking after his group coming out from the bottom, which puts pressure on white.  On the left, black jumps out (better as a dogface one space over).  Everything seems good!

![dia 6](images/l20250207/igo6.jpg)

Black doesn’t play b1 making white heavy, then be to keep white’s groups separated.  Black has 2 living groups on the right (connecting them is not a priority).  Keeping white separated is a priority (making profit is ‘the’ priority).  White can’t make profit from its invasion of the right, so black has the advantage.

![dia 7](images/l20250207/igo7.jpg)

B2, creating cutting points, is a crucial mistake.  It’s presenting white with an opportunity.  Black at p12 would have been much better (than having white there).

![dia 8](images/l20250207/igo8.jpg)

Even allowing the two white groups to join is not very important, as they haven’t made any profit.  Black at r18 would be a good profit point for black.  Getting into the space at the top would be good to keep white small there.  There are lots of places for black to expand for a profit or reduce white’s potential.  The fight on the right has already been won by black (if black stops attacking).

![dia 9](images/l20250207/igo9.jpg)

Like a dog with a bone, black won’t let go of his attack on white.  What is black trying to do at o9?  Too many open doors and a couple of windows!

![dia 10](images/l20250207/igo10.jpg)

White has a choice of taking the Atari to be completely secure or push his luck on the other black stone.  Again, this is not a fight that black needs to be in.  R18 secures the upper right, then start making profit elsewhere.

![dia 11](images/l20250207/igo11.jpg)

Black insisted on connecting under, then thought an Atari on r14 was possible, so protected it, instead of b1.

At this point, it would have been an even game.  Watch the video for the exciting conclusion!

The Game of Go is more about ‘Live Long and Prosper’, than ‘Kill Them All’.  Only fight for your life or if it brings profit.

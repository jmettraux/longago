## Lesson 2024-11-01

Let’s start by looking at the end result, then see how the moves after the opening allowed things to end up the way they did.

![image 1](images/l20241101/igo1.jpg)

John had two 3-4 stones facing each other at the top.  I approached the top left high and the top right low.  At the bottom, my 3-4 stones on the left faced him and he approached high.  My 4-4 stones on the right was Keima approached from the outside.  I was basically able to maintain my corners and actually expanded on the right.  At the top, John lost any points on the right and was reduced/pushed low  on the left.

Here are the opening sequences.

![image 3](images/l20241101/igo3.jpg)

The lower left and upper left are equivalent structures.  B1 was a one space jump, while w4, taking advantage of the 2 stone wall jumped out 2 spaces.  The Keima of w2 got white onto the 4th line and ahead of b1, so b3 was good, but not a local threat (just capping).  More important was for w4 to also jump out and prevent black from jumping out on both sides (white would get to jump out on both sides at the top).  Although w2 blocked b1, black didn’t block w4, but instead jumped out.

In response, w1 jumps out to cap black on the right side and b2 jumps out to add depth to his right.  Now, w3 switches to jump out from the top right to start a pocket.  The sector line is rather loose at this point with nothing in the center to tie them together.  B4 & b6 only work to connect the right to the left, but it’s just a thin line, while white, in response, has connected across the bottom with points behind its line of stones.

The stone marked b1 here is an irritant from earlier that threatens to jump further into the center and top.  How do I deal with that threat?  Well, not directly, in this case.  W1 is a peep that threatens to push through the one space jump.  B3 is thinking about the connection along the side, which is good, but white can push black down and create cutting points.  With white stronger here, b1 will be easier to deal with.  Unfortunately for black, instead of connecting on the right side of b9 (alternate b1),  black X connects on the left side.  The other b1 was depending on black connecting solidly at alternate b1.

W1 Atari, w3, w5 and w6 work together to cut off the black stone and starts to put stones in the center to strengthen the sector line from left to right.  At the same time, the thin line of black stones from earlier are still thin.  Black switches to add depth to the right side, but it’s already too little, too late.

A few more stones close off white’s huge pocket and white is ahead 40 points.  In endgame, white will do the pushing and take another 50 points from black.

After the opening, we have to think ahead to where we can increase our potential while decreasing our opponent’s potential.  Getting to key points first is important.  Responding with appropriate blocking is important, but when can we ignore their move and play a bigger move elsewhere?  If we play elsewhere, will they follow?  How valuable are the various moves?  There is lots to learn as we gain insight from experience.

Getting somewhere first is important, so having Sente is important.  Sente means being able to lead, continue or having the initiative.  Gote means turning Sente over to your opponent.

![image 9](images/l20241101/igo9.jpg)

This is an example of a small sequence that will end in gote for black.  Playing at b6 would have kept Sente.

![image 10](images/l20241101/igo10.jpg)

When white plays w2, black is threatened with Atari if white plays at b6, so black plays there, ending in gote.  White doesn’t need to follow up here, so white can take Sente elsewhere.

![image 11](images/l20241101/igo11.jpg)

Here is the same situation, but white plays f18, rather than e18.

![image 12](images/l20241101/igo12.jpg)

When black blocks, white doesn’t need to play again, as there is no Atari threat like before.  White can take Sente elsewhere.

![image 13](images/l20241101/igo13.jpg)

Being on the 2nd line under your opponent’s 3rd line position threatens a huge intrusion and reduction called a monkey jump.  It is an ogeima (Keima +1 more space) from the 2nd line to the first line.  There is nothing black can do to disconnect w2 from safety.

White is going to connect back, so you want to limit the damage as much as possible.  We can force white to make specific moves with a sacrifice stone.

![image 17](images/l20241101/igo17.jpg)

This is the same as directly above and b3 is the sacrifice stone.  We force w6 to take by an Atari in b4 with b5.  After w6 takes b3, b7 forces white to fill at d19.  Black will eventually fill at c17 and white gets e18.  Black can’t play e18, as it’s self-atari.

One other ‘changing directions’ moment. John moved to squeeze out from the left, however, keeping two large living groups connected is not a priority.  The left and right can live on their own.  Instead, use the aji of the h11 stone to disrupt/reduce the huge center I’m threatening.  I think a 2 space jump to the right works best, since it gets ahead of white’s j9, so it has lots of directions it can go.  The distance back to h11 is also not that far, so white has to worry about black cutting at g11 and setting the 3 white stones adrift.

Main point today was not blocking on the left side when I jumped out, letting me jump out first upper right and not playing for a reduction of the big center.

## Lesson 2025-06-13

A very tactical and calculated game from John today.  It didn’t seem like he hadn’t played in a month.

We had a solid standard start, then John closed off the top right corner, expecting I’d step back.

![dia 2](images/l20250516/igo2.jpg)

B1  two spaced jumped from a 2 stone wall, so w2 calmly blocked.  The invasion on the right was ill advised (unless you were going to follow through and run), as there is no space for a base.  You have to expect the lower corner to move out, so black needs to move too, then when the top responds, black needs to move into the center.

Expanding the center is an idea.

![dia 4](images/l20250516/igo4.jpg)

..or expand from a dogface attachment.

![dia 5](images/l20250516/igo5.jpg)

Instead of supporting the invasion, black 2 space jumped from a 2 space extension.  Although somewhat flimsy, it was strong enough to not approach it too closely when white  went to reduce the top.  Also, playing an invasion on the 3rd line would have been much too risky.

![dia 6](images/l20250516/igo6.jpg)

B1 was a good response.  W2 was to get a presence on the edge, but b3 meant white should scoot into the center.

![dia 7](images/l20250516/igo7.jpg)

White’s response to b1 shows what was being prioritized (keep the single stone dead and the right side big.  At the top, the 3 stones being able to escape was also important, living on the edge at the top not very.

![dia 8](images/l20250516/igo8.jpg)

Black found the sweet spot and cut the 3 stones off from the top edge.  White fought back, but then switched to reducing the bottom, as I had no good answer yet on how to limit the damage at the top.  If black extends, then the top is completely lost.

![dia 9](images/l20250516/igo9.jpg)

Black turned to Atari at the top instead, giving me an extra move to push deeper at the bottom, plus the other two stones at the top still had aji.

![dia 10](images/l20250516/igo10.jpg)

Black could have defended the bottom and still have gotten a good result at the top.

![dia 11](images/l20250516/igo11.jpg)

Of course, extending would have been a better move than the turn Atari.

![dia 12](images/l20250516/igo12.jpg)

When b1 defended the bottom, white attached to attempt a rescue.  Black could still extend, but the attached black stone would suffer.

![dia 13](images/l20250516/igo13.jpg)

A bit of back and forth captured the one stone and white was safe in the center with the top rescued.

![dia 14](images/l20250516/igo14.jpg)

B1 sought to separate the stones at the bottom from connecting to the top, so white went down and around to connect to the corner.

![dia 15](images/l20250516/igo15.jpg)

In hindsight, extending might have been better.

![dia 16](images/l20250516/igo16.jpg)

For white as well, as I didn’t realize that the black stones were vulnerable to being cut off (without eye?)

![dia 17](images/l20250516/igo17.jpg)

Black found an interesting move here, which left me puzzled.

![dia 18](images/l20250516/igo18.jpg)

I thought that black gave up the one stone too quickly.

![dia 19](images/l20250516/igo19.jpg)

Why not extend once?

![dia 20](images/l20250516/igo20.jpg)

..then sacrifice the two.

That’s it for today….gotta get Chicken Curry with Naan for lunch!

## Lesson 2025-05-09

A bit of a glitch at the beginning (no Go board), but after discovering my error, I had OGS run through the opening moves again, so the whole game is there.

![dia 1](images/l20250509/igo1.jpg)

It was after the opening corner moves that I realized I hadn’t pushed the button for the board.  Two high approaches at the top, but I went with a low approach at the bottom, due to the marked black stone.  With a low approach, you get a full 3 space extension.

John found the correct 1st move after the opening, expanding his group while restricting mine.  W2 jumps into the center creating a solid dogface structure.  Having just solidified his left side group, jumping at the top seems misplaced (also a two space jump is standard, however, that doesn’t become a problem).  Instead, strengthening the group at the bottom seems more important. Pushing into the corner is a small, but very solidifying move that, if not responded to let’s black take the corner.  Jumping out from the far end stone puts pressure on white’s weakest group.

The jump at the top doesn’t become a problem because as soon as white attaches, black steps back.  Now black is in a position to push at g16 and harass the single white stone.  W2 takes away a push by black and usually gets black to step back (or lose the stone).  Jumping out to j6 is the correct follow up to b4.

W1, of course, needs to respond to black to get his weak group into the open.  Black then plays a move that is ambivalent in its intentions.  Is it trying to help the right or the bottom?

![dia 5](images/l20250509/igo5.jpg)

If you want to help the top, slide it over a bit to create a solid dogface to work with your stones at the top.  Unfortunately, this leaves the bottom very vulnerable.

![dia 6](images/l20250509/igo6.jpg)

B1 jumping to create a box is the safest move, especially if b3 steps back in response to w2 pushing.  White might take the threatened black stone, but black has a nice handful of points and can jump out.

![dia 7](images/l20250509/igo7.jpg)

If black hanes then this is likely, plus white can still take the stone at the bottom.

![dia 8](images/l20250509/igo8.jpg)

B1 could partner up with the other stone on the 6th line with lots of possibilities.

![dia 9](images/l20250509/igo9.jpg)

Naturally, white is going to push and ask about the light connections.

![dia 10](images/l20250509/igo10.jpg)

B1 could have dropped down for this sequence.

![dia 11](images/l20250509/igo11.jpg)

Black could have saved the one stone in this way.

![dia 12](images/l20250509/igo12.jpg)

…but most importantly, b1 could have extended here to isolate the 3 white stones to get compensation for being pushed around earlier.


![dia 13](images/l20250509/igo13.jpg)

Instead, a hane leads to a double Atari.  Now white has a way out.

![dia 14](images/l20250509/igo14.jpg)

Once the single stone is taken, white needs to extend and attack the single black stone.  Having black take back the Atari would be inconvenient, but not critical.

![dia 15](images/l20250509/igo15.jpg)

When white ataris, b1 should connect, then retaking means the 4 white stones are isolated.

![dia 16](images/l20250509/igo16.jpg)

Now white can connect out by filling the white stone Atari or by taking the black stone Atari (into another Atari) and filling there.  Black’s beautiful pocket is officially gone.

![dia 17](images/l20250509/igo17.jpg)

There could have been an interesting fight had b1 saved the 2nd Atari.

![dia 18](images/l20250509/igo18.jpg)

Black still had a huge right side (the score was reasonable) that white needed to reduce or, at least keep from expanding.  There is that elephant eye that would cut white’s bottom group off from the center.

![dia 19](images/l20250509/igo19.jpg)

Another extension by b1 would have been very solid and left white with fewer targets.  With a more solid position, black could also do more.

![dia 20](images/l20250509/igo20.jpg)

Black allowed white to take a stone in the lower right corner, but saw the squeeze attack on the two black stones, so white closed the elephant eye.

![dia 21](images/l20250509/igo21.jpg)

I had considered w1 as a better connection, but played one space higher (creating problems later).

![dia 22](images/l20250509/igo22.jpg)

I foolishly left m1 vulnerable to Atari, as with friends nearby it is safe, however, there was a good attack after the diagonal.

![dia 23](images/l20250509/igo23.jpg)

After I ataried up, w1 only needed to extend, making white’s corner safe.  With it safe, the black stones could no longer do any damage.  I was over thinking things…and so…

![dia 24](images/l20250509/igo24.jpg)

..I played one space higher at o3, leaving an Atari for b1.  A nice reduction, but not catastrophic.  Unfortunately, black was also overthinking, so didn’t see the mistake I didn’t see, so I wasn’t punished.

It was a fun game, and we had a Swiss newbie in Chat.

We started with standards joseki with John approaching the 4-4 corner first.  After I played the 2nd corner high, I realized low would have given me a better extension.

The first moves after the corners are done can really set up the tone of what’s to come.  B1 is much too close, so a pincer by white is expected.  Jumping out from b1 would be a threat on the white stone and also, indirectly white’s corner.

A modest expansion would get one in return, leaving black to then extend at the bottom.  On the right, a two space connected to a one space is ideal, but a 2 space extending from a 3 space is riskier, so black would want to come back soon and reduce the risk by jumping out from the bottom.

Picking a fight at the top seems unnecessary.  B3 jumps away lightly, so white also jumps out to keep b3 separated from the right.  B1 would have been better jumping out from the r8 stone.

When black diagonals out, white jumps out from the right, which now puts r8 behind the sector line.  When black jumps out again, white starts to think about the safety of his group, by opening up access to the center on his left (and threatening an Atari).

![dia 8](images/l20250314/igo8.jpg)

Black jumps left, so white diagonally attaches to black, looking to keep the two groups separated and perhaps attack the corner at some point.

![dia 9](images/l20250314/igo9.jpg)

As black resists with the one group, it pushes white towards a greater threat on the other.

![dia 10](images/l20250314/igo10.jpg)

Seeing that black beefs up the other group. B1 seems odd, as now white gets in front.

![dia 11](images/l20250314/igo11.jpg)

By keeping in front, black would have strength to attack white’s group on the left.

![dia 12](images/l20250314/igo12.jpg)

Despite having a weak group on the left, white keeps pushing through.  This should be the last move block that black makes before turning towards attacking the left.

![dia 13](images/l20250314/igo13.jpg)

Unfortunately, when white cuts/atari, black saves the stone and white extends.

![dia 14](images/l20250314/igo14.jpg)

Perhaps, something like this.

![dia 15](images/l20250314/igo15.jpg)

White continues to attack and surround, so black needs to make eyes.

![dia 16](images/l20250314/igo16.jpg)

At this point, b1 leaning on white might have provided a way to save the 2 black stones.

![dia 17](images/l20250314/igo17.jpg)

Black exerted pressure on white to made a nice run to secure the corner!

I’m going to leave it there, as the significant stones were the wayward,abandoned r8 and the impetuous m16.  Not doing anything with the lower left black group and not putting pressure on the upper left white group were big picture issues.  We had a few chatters today who were looking for ‘fighting’.  Hmm, fight when necessary, but it’s better to negotiate (for a larger share of the board).

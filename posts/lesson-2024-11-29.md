## Lesson 2024-11-29

The audio is back and it’s short, so watch it first, then consider my thoughts on the game.

Whoa!  What happened to corners first?

If you really want that point on the left side, do the approach first and use the extension from the top as the extension from the bottom (leaving you an extra stone to play).

Since my corner wasn’t approached, I do a high enclosure, as that works well with the high extension stone from the lower left.

In response, John takes another big point at the top.  This kind of play is perfectly ok, but you have to know how to use it.  Playing on J rather than K would have helped with the follow up.

Instead, black might have threatened to slide under my high stone, making his right side stronger, then completely closed off the left.

My response to his big point was to approach his 4-4 corner, which put both of us into loose pincers.  After my extension w5, b1 should have gotten a base (J, instead of K, would have made this a 2 space base).  White would have wanted to jump out and b3 would follow.  Black now has friends on the right that can support the top.

Instead, black jumped out from his strong side, pushing w2 to threaten his stone.  When b3, white should have pushed once to securely contain the black stone.

Before pushing right, I wanted to get a cut in, which would also give me an eye.  I had little hope for the cutting stone, but it seemed like a good spot to leave behind some aji for later, and it wasn’t strengthening black, so why not?

![image 8](images/l20241129/igo8.jpg)

My plan was to get a wall and create a huge pocket behind it, even though I could see it wouldn’t be completely solid.  The aji of the 2 stones should help direct black’s response.

The aji threat worked better than expected, but saving the Atari stone would not have been a problem.

Black has too much strength in the area and can weather the storm.

![image 12](images/l20241129/igo12.jpg)

I got my wall and broke through his line, but he then activated the top midpoint stone.  Unfortunately, this should have been a diagonal out.

![image 13](images/l20241129/igo13.jpg)

W1 secures an eye, w3 responded to b2, but I feared the black stones at the top more than b4 intruding and reducing.

![image 14](images/l20241129/igo14.jpg)

I think black could have fought successfully for his top stones.

![image 15](images/l20241129/igo15.jpg)

Instead, he drove me to secure the top, which was more points than he was getting.

…and I got to block b4.

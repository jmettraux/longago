![dia 1](images/l20250221/igo1.jpg)

A standard opening.  Black approached low bottom right, white high top right, Keima approach to my 4-4 stone bottom left, then I approached high even though it left my extension cramped in the top left.

![dia 2](images/l20250221/igo2.jpg)

Black split the bottom, white took away its base, so black jumped out.  Very standard and being in the open with room to run or spread out, black is safe.

![dia 3](images/l20250221/igo3.jpg)

Since black jumped out, white also needed to jump out.  Black jumped left, so white defended diagonally. Black added a diagonal stone for a wider presence to jump further into the center.  When white Keima jumped to e6, black needed to do something with the group on the left.  H4 wasn’t a big move for white, but a necessary response to black getting closer.  Black jumping out from the left to e9 would be both a small defensive move and a bigger whole board move, as it threatens the white group.  Pushing into the corner would also be a good defensive move, but not as necessary as getting into the center.

When black jumped out from the top, white naturally jumped out with its group.  White jumps, black jumps would be a new reason for black to e9. However, black pushes white towards black’s vulnerable group?

Black makes a nice dogface for the center group, so w1 jumps out to get in front of the center group.  B2 response with a jump too, but I think on the wrong side.  The center is doing ok, but black has a 3 space, 3 space, 2 space structure on the right

![dia 6](images/l20250221/igo6.jpg)

With black cut off from the corner, it was time to cut it off from the center, while connecting my two groups.

![dia 7](images/l20250221/igo7.jpg)

Here, white is fully connected across the left, so black’s move is not an attack upon it.  Threatening the group at the top would seem to give the best results.  Start with a cap or off-center cap from the left, then switch to the right side (which will also defend while applying pressure).  As a backup, the center group will help to cut off one avenue of movement and help to make a pocket by capping the left.

![dia 8](images/l20250221/igo8.jpg)

Another idea, would be to secure the group on the left by pushing out and threatening to break through and break up white’s position.  White’s resulting wall has already been neutralized and black has free movement into the center.

![dia 9](images/l20250221/igo9.jpg)

Instead, w1 got to jump first and got a nice rounded position in the center.  While black got a wall and connection between his groups, white was poised to reduce any benefits from the wall.

![dia 10](images/l20250221/igo10.jpg)

The one space jump from the center is typically a good move to add depth to your side position.  However, here there is the vulnerability of that 3 space gap due to the closeness of white’s stones. B1 may be able to tie the right side together.

![dia 11](images/l20250221/igo11.jpg)

First, white punctures black’s potential pocket.

![dia 12](images/l20250221/igo12.jpg)

Black responses locally, white gets the pocket, then jumps to the midpoint of the 3 space gap.  A little risky, as black could attack the elephant eye to push into white’s area - not fatal, but reductive.

![dia 13](images/l20250221/igo13.jpg)

After that fight stabilized, it was time to settle the corner group.  If black attacks, he could do some damage!

![dia 14](images/l20250221/igo14.jpg)

Unfortunately, black doesn’t attack with his main weapon (the 3 stone wall).  Push in and down, then around p7 to connect and make a pocket.

![dia 15](images/l20250221/igo15.jpg)

White wasn’t able to sneaky snake very far, so secured the corner with q4.  Now black could reduce, but nothing serious.

![dia 16](images/l20250221/igo16.jpg)

White wanted to settle the area top left, so dropped down at b14, the pushed at d16.  The Hane at e17 was going to split off the corner, but it had eyespace, so no worries.  Unfortunately, black cut into an immediate Atari with no escape.

![dia 17](images/l20250221/igo17.jpg)

Nothing to worry about until black played the marked stone.

![dia 18](images/l20250221/igo18.jpg)

Start with the counter atari of b1.  The center is going to get cut off from the center, but everything’s safe.

![dia 19](images/l20250221/igo19.jpg)

Further along, black could have connected the Atari to make eyes in the corner.

![dia 20](images/l20250221/igo20.jpg)

Black’s going to get some stones cut off, but black has aji to leverage, so should be able to get reduction to compensate for the lost stones.

![dia 21](images/l20250221/igo21.jpg)

,,,and then there was white’s attack on black’s eyespace (or lack thereof) in the lower left.

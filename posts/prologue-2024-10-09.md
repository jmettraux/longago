As for the game, the opening is the foundation that the rest of the game is built upon.  It is very complex, so we simplify the opening by restricting the corner joseki that we use.  Our focus is initially to get you to see the Big Picture.  In every game, I want you to play two 3-4 corners and I will play a 3-4 and a 4-4.  For this, you’ll need to decide which direction your stone is going to face.  I will approach one of your corners high and the other low.  You may approach my 3-4 corner either high or low.  For the 4-4 corner you need to decide which side to approach from.  For reference, here are the 3 joseki we are going to use.

High approach with the extension low.  You can put the 10th line stone on the 4th line.

Low approach with the extension high.  You can play the 11th line stone on the 3rd line (low).

Our 4-4 joseki with an approach from the left.  You could approach from the top.

As to the facing of the 3-4 stone.  Each corner has two 3-4 spots and the direction that you and your opponent will take depends on which facing/point you put your stone on.  The placement of your initial stone doesn’t matter to you, as it’s the first stone on the board, but the next three corner stones should consider which direction the black and white stones will go during the joseki.

Here are the two 3-4 spots for red.  The red arrow is the red player’s direction and the blue arrow sends blue in the other direction.

Oh yeah.  We may play several openings, rather than a full game, as we want to see how facings change development of stones on the board.

### Update 2024-10-18

These are the 3 joseki we use...

We use just the three in order to simplify the opening.  There are enough variables to these three, so we want to understand them and how they affect the rest of the board first.  Just the facing of the 3-4 stones in relation to the stones in the other corners creates  major differences.  However, we really want to focus on what to do on the board after the corner sequences are done, so we restrict ourselves to the three.

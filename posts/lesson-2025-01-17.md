## Lesson 2025-01-17

In The Godfather (1972), we learned that you should ‘keep your friend close, but your enemies closer’.  This doesn’t apply to Go.  As your enemies get close, you want your friends closer.

The first 3 corners were standard.  In the 4th 3-4 corner, I approached low, so I could get a good extension.  Along the way, however, John extended high Keima, rather than a simple one space extension.  I was already thinking about how to take advantage of that deviation - maybe yes, maybe no, but thinking about it.  When playing other newbies, if you play strong, you can take advantage of their non-standard moves

R12 seemed like a good place to break up his right side.  However, a simple b1 kick, then b3 to steal my base would be the basic way to defend.

Instead, black pushed from his strong side towards his loose formation, then kicked my Keima slide.

If you push into a weak structure….if your enemies get close to your weakness, you need to get friends closer to bolster your position.  B1 makes a solid connection, then it’s you chasing them.

Being loose, white pushed through to connect his two groups and separate black from the safety of his corner.  At this point, we should all see the cut that the marked white stone can make on the Keima.

By jumping out, white gives black the perfect opportunity to protect against the cut.  With the stones on the right side solidly connected, black exerts a lot of influence.

White wants to cut, but is patient, waiting for all the other elements to fall into place.  Black’s Keima slide on the left is a good move and pushes white up and out.  However, jumping out from the top, helps white to get another element of his surround into place.  Black still has time to protect at p9.

This last move by black (attachment?) is very misplaced.  Those 3 white stones are floating, so you’d need to surround from a distance.  N11 might have been a good move, as it makes the Keima cut irrelevant and puts pressure on the 3 white stones.

However, black keeps pushing white to be stronger and white’s escape into the center is the barrier white needs before being able to cut.  W1 was intended as black’s last chance to fix the cut, but black instead plays a non-threatening move giving white Sente.

White cuts and black has no way to capture it and reconnect his group.  When your enemy gets close, you need to be suspicious and look at the stones on the board.  Find the weakness that your enemy sees and fix it.  It’s not being ‘puppy Go’ defensive, if you can find ways to fix your weaknesses that put pressure on your opponent.

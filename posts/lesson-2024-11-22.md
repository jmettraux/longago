A sneaky snake neutralizes territory in this game.

We followed standard openings, for the most part, with black taking the sides and white the top and bottom.  Black’s d14 is one space higher than standard, and white jumps to o15, rather than extending because the extension from the left at k16 acts like an extension for the right too, since the jump makes for a nice sector line.

B1 is a defensive response to white’s jump, but white is good at the top, so w2 jumps from the bottom, setting up one side of a pocket at the bottom.  I don’t like black’s last move here, as it has little added benefit.  It would be better to jump out from the left side, top or bottom, or play the star midpoint along the bottom!  The bottom is very open, so a good place to establish a position from which to negate white’s potential to create a huge pocket (spoiler).

From this position, black can Keima to miai points on the 3rd line or retreat to the 5th line or jump into the center where he can seek support from either side.

Another good spot for black would have been to jump out to where w1 went.  With black there, white would have been kept low at the bottom, while black would have added depth to the side.

White attaching to the inside of b2 is telling black that they jumped out too far.  Playing f6 or f7 would have been better.

When white plays on the inside, it is also telling black that white has eyes on the midpoint of the extension, so jumping out here is failing to defend at a critical time.  Clamping by playing e7 is a good move.  White will play this same defensive move later.

Patience is important, even if waiting sometimes gives you opponent time to fix an issue.  Better to lose an opportunity, than to rush into your own disaster.  Therefore, w1 controls the black stone and puts an additional stone in the area to support the split.  Black has a chance to defend at d8 or e7, but b2 jumps instead.  W3 defends against black doing what white wants to do.  Again, black could defend at d8 or e7, but b4 pushes instead.  White has already defended there, so plays to split at d8.

It’s a little painful to be pushed low, but black has support when white splits, so it doesn’t have to be a disaster.

Unfortunately, black left a door open and white walked through, then ataried to a capture on the edge.  At this point, the game is essentially over - white can just cruise to a win.

Cruising doesn’t mean you don’t have to be vigilant, as fortunes can quickly change in Go.   When black plays the marked stone, white sees the threat and plays connectively - a diagonal and a Keima, at a distance.  Distance is important for defense.

If white plays tight at w1, it leaves behind the elephant eye at b2 and black can sneaky snake into white’s pocket.

When white attaches here, probably a standard extension is better, as it doesn’t leave s cutting point yo worry about.  Besides, the b1 hane just pushes white to extend.

A sneaky snake relies on your opponent playing too close.  It’s better to realize early that a position is weak, and play a more solid move at a distance from the incursion.  The marked black stone looks innocent, but if white plays close at X, looking at a double Atari by playing k15 next, there is a cutting point left behind.  The marked blue stone is solid and doesn’t leave any weaknesses.  The double Atari may still be there later, so just be patient.   It’s better to be safe, than sorry.  Let your opponent take risks and leave behind weaknesses that you can exploit.

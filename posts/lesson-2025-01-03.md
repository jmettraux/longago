## Lesson 2025-01-03

A fairly good game today, as the score was close.  However, it also had those narrow black areas and chubby white areas due to missed opportunities.  The early stones determine much of what you’ll be able to do, so being able to see and read the landscape is important.

Our opening sequences gave John the sides and white the top and bottom.  The big 5 space gap on the right was a target for white, so black decided to jump out to help defend it.  Perhaps, black should have played q5 himself and created a very strong right side.  White, of course, had to target the ‘potential’ of what could be created if black placed another stone in the area. Q5 is on the sector line, so a reducing move, rather than an invasion, intended to puncture black’s potential.  These 2 moves are setting the foundation for what is to come.

Black plays a Keima to lean on white, which will push white towards the top.  To make use of his stone and open up his position, black will need to play in the opposite direction as well.  If white plays at the bottom first, black will have a narrow position.

Perhaps, b1 could have improved his sector line by jumping out at the top, forcing w2 to also jump out.  B3 could jump out again at the bottom, with an eye on the midpoint of white’s approach position, or black could jump out at the top, extending the movement of b1.  White can Keima to make one eye on the edge, but will have to continue into the center (making no territory).

As expected, white got pushed towards safety at the top, creating a wall to keep black contained against the edge and give white territory behind it.  Black’s pushing stones haven’t created a comparable position yet.  Now might be the time to approach white’s sector line and hopefully get territorial profit while reducing white’s potential.

Instead, black jumps out into the center.  Is this because of the cutting point at p6?  I’d view this as a Miai situation, so no need to act until white prevents one or the other.  This move gains nothing, while giving white Sente to play a big territorial move ‘anywhere’.  Black needs to take away some of white’s good moves by playing moves that benefit black (while threatening white).

White jumps out from the bottom left and black jumps out from the top left.  White could respond to block black from jumping again at the top, but instead jumps again into the center.  White has enough at the top even if black pushes white back, however, white’s pushing into the center will hollow out anything black does at the top.  One can’t be overly protective.  Evaluate the value of your moves (how much expand or protect me vs how much reduce them).

Black does push forward and white steps back and defends.  White gets a good result behind his position, but black will have a narrow position, essentially after white takes k7.  Whatever black does to push into white’s position, white will just step back and defend sensibly, keeping connected and profiting behind the defensive line.

Stepping back to defend will keep your line strong.  Having anchor stones on the key spots is important, so evaluating the board early and getting to those key spots first sets up the correct conditions for both attacking and defending.  Don’t be greedy with your assertive moves or your defensive moves.  That’s it for today.  Enjoy the video!

Oh yeah, let’s look at the board if b1 is at the midpoint of the right side.  Red lines are two space extensions and green are 2 space ogeima, which in isolation would not be good.  However, look at white’s position.  A  three space extension and 3 space Ogeima at the top and bottom.  Black has the better targets and should have an easier time breaking up white’s positions.

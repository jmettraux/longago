### Thursday instructions

Last time, you opened with two 3-4s facing in a pinwheel pattern.

This time, I’d like you to try one of these two patterns, both facing to yourself or both facing to your opponent.

Work out how the joseki sequences would end up looking and decide which you’d like to try.

I’ll stick with one 3-4 and a 4-4.

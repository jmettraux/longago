## Lesson 2024-11-08

Here is today’s game.  We used the goban until I noticed the left side and right side weren’t meeting up correctly (how’d that happen), then switched to OBS view only.  An interesting game, although we did break from our standard opening sequences.

We were fine with the first 2 corners, both high approaches to 3-4 stones.  Black should have taken Sente to approach the lower left corner either high or low, leaving me to take on his 4-4 stones (first time for him to play a 4-4).

Instead, he played an ogeima enclosure off of his 4-4 stone.  As a beginner, I think we should be sticking to approaches, but if you want to do an enclosure, then a 3-4 stone is much better to work with than a 4-4.  Then, if you do enclose a 4-4, you’d better keep it to a Keima, rather than an ogeima.

Since black enclosed, white needs to enclose too.   Comparing the two enclosures, the gold standard white one puts white ahead, as black’s loose structure is more vulnerable.   As an alternative, I had thought to do a 2 space 4th line extension, since I’ve got that solid 3rd line stone on the right.  However, I went with the solid standard Keima enclosure.

Black responded, by doing a double wing, extending on the 4th line.  I took a spot near the midpoint, then black dropped to the 3rd line, being a Keima from his stone and my stone, threatening to slide with another Keima to the 2nd line.  Due to the distance of my stone to the corner, there is also a threat to play a Keima on the other side at c7.  Black could then either connect back by playing at b9 or jump out.  I ignored that I went for the 3-3 invasion teaching moment.  The double wings makes living in the corner difficult for white, but it was time for John to see the dreaded 3-3.

I believe b1 here is the standard follow up to prevent being 3-3’d.

![image 6](images/l20241108/igo6.jpg)

Typically, if you play a 4-4 opening, you ‘expect’ to be 3-3’d and you follow one of the many responses (this one is basic), letting the invader take the corner, taking outside influence as compensation.  Trying to keep the corner after playing 4-4 basically means you should have played 3-4 instead.

Here are the 2 ways c11 can be used, if white doesn’t respond locally.

![image 9](images/l20241108/igo9.jpg)

Black let me off easy in the corner.  Black blocking at d17 means the 3rd line extension isn’t going to be used for blocking, instead the 4th line extension has to block (?).

![image 10](images/l20241108/igo10.jpg)

By starting with c16, white is going to contend with a well positioned 3rd line black stone and will be better contained.

Back to the previous screenshot, the attachment at c9 gets shut down easily, as white only needs to hane at c8.  A black b9 slide is much more difficult for white to contain.

![image 11](images/l20241108/igo11.jpg)

White was able to get a wall and cut off one black stone.  However, white’s position is still very open from the right, and black still has room to invade at the bottom.  However, instead of playing a move to help block off the right, I wanted to secure the top (no loose ends).

What I didn’t want to see was b2 starting to undermine my group at the top.

![image 12](images/l20241108/igo12.jpg)

This was the real beginning of the end..for black, instead of white.  This stone has so many directions it can go in that it should be poised to reduce most of the pocket that white wants to get.  How could this move go wrong?  Since I ‘know’ that I’m getting reduced in a big way (black got through before I could post pickets), I decided to sow chaos, using the distances between black’s positions as leverage.  The 3 space positions have the midpoints marked, while the others are 2 space positions.  John only needs to remember where his friends are and spread out to create more avenues to link up with friends.

![image 13](images/l20241108/igo13.jpg)

I split the nearest 3 spacer and something like this should have happened. B1 protects the midpoint on the side, then b3 connects to the center stones after white pushes.  Black still has lots of directions available.

If that last 2 spacer had been a single space, then b3 would have been a more stable dogface.

![image 14](images/l20241108/igo14.jpg)

This is what happened when black plays a move that doesn’t deal with white’s stone.

![image 15](images/l20241108/igo15.jpg)

Here b1 threatens to play at q5 (w2) cutting white off.  White must play w2 to stop that.  B3 is Atari, and b5 is Atari again.  Then black switches sides and b7 is another Atari.  Finally, b9 jumps out and white has been contained by using the aji of q5, a stone you intend to give up.  Sacrifice a little, give way a little, but maintain the basic integrity of your position.

![image 16](images/l20241108/igo16.jpg)

Here’s one more place where sacrifice saves lives.  Black has to give up the 2 stones.  Container white from the outside, b9 Atari forces white to take, then black needs to secure the connection.

…

Hmmmm….I went back and looked at the game on the video side by side with the game on OGS.  There isn’t any difference in the boards at the point when I switched to the OGS view, which was just when I was seeing an issue (no issue with mirroring the game, only with me - a glitch in my matrix!).  That ‘human error’ that you’re always hearing about is something everyone can look forward to as they age.

## Lesson 2025-01-10

A good match today with John.  Of course, there are lessons to be learned (about seeing the situation on the board).

After 3 normal corner joseki, John tried pressing down on my low approach stone in the 4th corner.  Black might be looking to get in the Hane to keep white out of the corner.

Back in the 90s, this joseki was still being played and suggested in the Go books, but not seen much these days.  However, it gives a good result for both players.

John decided to go for a 3 stone wall to anchor his right side, but this allowed me to slide into the corner and extend for a base for a living shape.

After white extended on the left side, black needs to understand that the 3 space extension is now unstable.  We do a lot of 3 space extensions in the opening.  If attacked immediately, we can defend them well, as we’ll have friends nearby and our opponent not.  However, when your opponent puts friends in the area, we need to defend.

B1 is a gold standard move to protect our weakness.  Now that you’re stronger there, white might want to protect one of the two 3 spaces gaps at the bottom.  This then gives you the opportunity to roll over the top and push under white’s position at the top before then jumping out with b11, finally getting to the spot you wanted to take.

Black had to give up one stone, but was starting to get a wall.  He also still had the option of rolling over white’s position at the top to create 2 sides of a huge pocket.  Then, attacking white at the bottom would give him a third side.  White has to act now!

Something small, like a one or two space jump from the side is not going to be enough.  White goes almost to the middle of the board and away from black’s stones, because he’ll need room to move.  Black’s move was unexpected.  I would have liked to see an attack on the midpoint to put more troops in the area first.

A simple one space jump away from black’s stone was my response, so black put more stones in the area with a loose surround of the top.  R14 is the kind of solid defense that I like to see in response to white’s push.

Back to the center for white who needs to expand to get eye space.  A dogface is a nice structure to work with.  I would want to see black do a one space jump towards his side position, to keep connected, to keep white disconnected and to make an attack on the bottom stronger.

A Keima jump is going to need another move from black, while a one space wouldn’t necessarily.  White, of course, responds by safely expanding his position while threatening to encroach further and perhaps cut something off.

![dia 11](images/l20250110/igo11.jpg)

We then got into a little tussle where white cut through the Keima.  Not saving the ataried stone was a lost opportunity for black to squeeze white at the bottom.

Black can easily separate white into two groups and the one group will need to be more concerned with dying than attacking.  This would also result in a better position to attack the center group.

John and I had a good basic game today.  Let’s look at some of the decisions!

![dia 1](images/l20250411/igo1.jpg)

A very standard opening.  We each have two vulnerable groups.

![dia 2](images/l20250411/igo2.jpg)

I would be looking to expand one of the weaker groups, while restricting my opponent. If white gets pushed by b1, the natural inclination would be w2.  That encourages black to push into the center, which in turn gets white’s other group to jump into the center.  An alternative or follow up by white is to drop down to c2, which pushes black to extend to e2.

Black played on the right instead, so w2 took the side extension, which will develop into pressure on the left side group.  Black pushing into the corner secures one side of his base.  Instead of following through with e4, black switched to jump out from the left.  Getting over the top of white on the left would be good.  In response, white jumps out from his weakest group.  The natural impulse would be to also jump out.

John went back and pushed at e4 and white fell back. When white attached to f6, I would have extended up, but John was cautious of the w2 cut.  However, it would come under attack.  Black is alive at the bottom, so there is little risk and high reward to chase it.

White needed to take care of the weak group first.  Playing b1 at the appropriate time would have prevented a lot of distress for black.  W2 taking a little advantage of black’s strongest position (perhaps) would have been worth.  White’s wall is easily neutralized.  Even getting cut would be worse for white than black.

When ‘push comes to shove’, one needs to know the direction bodies will be flyin’.  Pushing up is not the direction you want your opponent to go.  Jumping right gets black into the open and threatens white’s pocket.

Concern for the group on the left, leaves black with few immediate options.  White’s 3 stones are relatively isolated, but they can move in multiple directions to find friends, so aren’t easily attacked.

![dia 8](images/l20250411/igo8.jpg)

Black leans in order to get a little more space for his group, so white leans back once, then switches directions to protect the top.  If black pushes over the top, white would extend, then either connect up with friends or have room to make living shape.  Jumping out from the right might be a good switching of directions for black.

![dia 9](images/l20250411/igo9.jpg)

At this point, black jumped and left the door open.  Perhaps, jumping from the midpoint would have been better (or even to h8).  There is also the jump from the right to consider.  The base of that group would also worry me - a drop to j2 would threaten a monkey jump, but white might not respond, but instead make a bigger move in the center.

![dia 10](images/l20250411/igo10.jpg)

White pushed through the door, but eventually need to connect (or lose stones), but black has a cut to protect.  Instead of directly protecting, black threw out a lifeline, so the 2 stones could escape to the right (if cut off).  Jumping out into white’s potential pocket might be worth it (even if white cuts and takes the 2 stones).

![dia 11](images/l20250411/igo11.jpg)

However, protecting cutting points is basic.  If white responds to protect the pocket, black could expand the right.

![dia 12](images/l20250411/igo12.jpg)

Unfortunately, white was able to jump first in a plus-minus move.

![dia 13](images/l20250411/igo13.jpg)

At the bottom, black fell for the double Atari move on the 1st line.  Falling back with b1 is the move.

![dia 14](images/l20250411/igo14.jpg)

The correct move has white ahead by 16.5.

![dia 15](images/l20250411/igo15.jpg)

A 10 point mistake!

![dia 16](images/l20250411/igo16.jpg)

This was also a crucial mistake, playing to secure eyes for a group that was already alive, which allowed white to expand the pocket.

![dia 17](images/l20250411/igo17.jpg)

Instead, black could have pushed back on the single white stone and moved plus-minus in the other direction.

That’s it for today!  Enjoy the video.

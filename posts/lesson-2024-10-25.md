## Lesson 2024-10-25

Here’s the video of today’s game.  Unfortunately, nobody stopped by to observe and chat, but I had trouble playing two boards (out of practice), so maybe that was for the best.  We’ll be playing again next week, so you can visit live then.

I believe John did the same thing last time - he didn’t finish the first approach before approaching a 2nd time.  Go is about sharing - you approach, I approach, you approach, I approach.  If you get greedy, bad things are going to happen.

![image 2](images/l20241025/igo2.jpg)

The 2nd approach went by the numbers, as did my approach in the upper left.  Now, since John hadn’t finished his sequence in the 1st corner, he had the next move and enclosed the top right.  Enclosures are really strong, but everyone’s tough until you get punched in the nose.  As your opponent’s stones get close, you have to defend appropriately.

![image 3](images/l20241025/igo3.jpg)

W1, of course, plays where black should have played (to finish his sequence), as that is the base make or base break point.  Black’s next move is odd, since his two stones are under attack.  The natural move is to ‘jump out into the center for safety’.  John already has an enclosure in the top right with an extension on either side, so extending now is premature - safety first!

![image 4](images/l20241025/igo4.jpg)

Of course, my first thought is to jump into the center for safety, but it also puts the 2 stones behind the sector line from p9 and q4.  Black then jumps and white caps with n6, loosely surrounding the 3 black stones.  For black to play away to jump out on the left, puts his group at great risk.  A diagonal move (alt b1) or a base move (alt b1) would both be good.  His b1 doesn’t directly threaten me, so I ignore and steal his base potential completely with w2.

![image 5](images/l20241025/igo5.jpg)

Lots of moves with the key ones numbered showing how I cut off b1.  The sequence, however, has made n6 (the capping stone) diagonally stronger, which is when black decides to diagonal out (finally).  Doing it before your moves make your opponent stronger in the area would have been better.

![image 6](images/l20241025/igo6.jpg)

However, after w1, black gives up on pushing out and extends on the right side again (abandoning his stones to make territory - not a bad idea).  However, it isn’t a threat to me, so I went back to play w3 (where black should have played when we had that exchange to moves).  I call this ‘getting your nose out’, as you’ve now made this area breathable for you (not closed off).  Despite black’s other mistakes, he was creating a huge pocket of potential territory, so getting my nose out into that area was essential to reduce his potential.  The appropriate move by black is b4 to get out ahead of me in a safe way that seals off most of the pocket.  You can’t have everything.  Just take what is legitimately yours, or you risk it by reaching too far.

![image 7](images/l20241025/igo7.jpg)

Black played the marked stone instead, so I pushed and we ended up with cutting points.  When you leave cutting points behind, you have to make a move like b1 that makes them manageable.

![image 8](images/l20241025/igo8.jpg)

Instead, John played the marked stone, leaving another cutting point, so w1 double ataried.  Usually, we would play g10 to save the more important stone.  G9 doesn’t save either, so after taking one, the other will still be in Atari.

![image 9](images/l20241025/igo9.jpg)

I take the more important one, black blocks, so I fill, because that gives me two cutting points and the Atari.

![image 10](images/l20241025/igo10.jpg)

We exchange some moves and b1 ataris my marked stone (which I don’t care about anymore, as it’s done its job).  W2 is more in line with my whole board objective.  B3 is black still thinking about the past, so w4 caps the right side, so I can make a pocket to offset the pocket that black has on the left.

![image 11](images/l20241025/igo11.jpg)

Black slides at the top, but I’m thinking about the center.  Black makes moves at the bottom, but I count liberties and keep my stones connected.  Black activates his ataried stone, but after I play the marked stone, I’m still well connected and black has nowhere to go.

![image 12](images/l20241025/igo12.jpg)

This was perhaps black’s best move of the game, threatening to push into my pocket and reduce my points there.  He’ll need to be able to connect back to one of his other stones without risking his position.  You’ll need to watch the video or review the game on OGS to see the ‘exciting’ conclusion!

### Addendum 2023-10-27

What should I have done in this situation?  The answer is usually, You shouldn’t have gotten yourself into that situation.

![image 13](images/l20241025/igo13.jpg)

Losing the bottom right started with not finishing the joseki.  Sharing two corners each is the way we create a level playing field.  Go is about finding the correct move for the situation on the board.

![image 14](images/l20241025/igo14.jpg)

Ok, so you’ve made a mistake and your opponent is calling you out.  Find the correct move for that situation.

![image 15](images/l20241025/igo15.jpg)

If black had simplified here, where would have white gone next. Keep pushing ahead?  Block black from jumping out at the bottom? Start to cap the right side from jumping out?  Extend at the bottom to restrict black there?  Black has a lot of moves to threaten white and white can only do one thing at a time.  If white doesn’t get a local response, then black takes Sente to play where they want.

![image 16](images/l20241025/igo16.jpg)

At this point black already has their pocket.  What is white going to do with their wall?  If black continues locally, then seal off the pocket with a solid two stones.  However, does black want white to keep the initiative? (Being behind by only 27 points is very good)

![image 17](images/l20241025/igo17.jpg)

It might be worth (perhaps) sacrificing some of your pocket to negate the power of white’s wall and threaten creating another large pocket of points.  A two space jump from that mid point is the safest.  You don’t want to get greedy and jump out too far.  Again, white can only play once before it’s your turn to play again.  Being able to play at the top to expand your sector line would be huge.  At some point, you should even be able to come back to the center.  Remember, if you play away and they follow, you can then go back to play the other move.

![image 18](images/l20241025/igo18.jpg)

If you decide to play solid to protect your pocket, w2 was the capping move I played.  B3 deepens the corner (be careful of the elephant eye of q14).  White might be protective of their pocket, so black just pushes a bit more and white keeps protecting and making points.

![image 19](images/l20241025/igo19.jpg)

Black and white both solidify and b13 fills in the elephant eye.

![image 20](images/l20241025/igo20.jpg)

..or b13 threatens to push through the gap into the center and white responds.  Notice that w14 steps back, rather than attaches to b13.  Reducing complications is often the right choice. B15 extends a bit at the top and w16 is a solid block, then b17 fills the elephant eye.

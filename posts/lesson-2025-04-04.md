We have the corner, sides, center rule for a reason.  Jimi Hendrix said, ‘And so castles made of sand, Fall in the sea eventually’.  Build a solid foundation before attempting to build in the center.

The first two corners went ok, but then black left a 3 and a 4 space gap to enclose a 4-4 stones.  Had it been a 3-4 stone, maybe, but  a 4-4 stone?

Had it been a high, rather than a low approach, then it would have been two 3 space gaps, better, but you still need some defense.  Jump out on either side or from the center stone.

Ignoring the left until the corners are done, white did a standard approach, got kicked and took a base.  Black tried to sweep the leg, but white rolled over the top to get center facing, so black pulled back.

W2 protected the base and White has center facing.  Black’s response was very strange and unproductive.  The bottom right is fine, so defending the left is more important.  If you want to play locally, turn at r8 or Keima jump.

Corners are done, so w1 takes a big side point.  B2 is a good start, but can’t hold the position by itself.  After w3 defends, the next 3 black stones help white to solidify, while perhaps thinking that it’s enough influence to build a castle in the center.  Unfortunately, the sides aren’t solid enough yet.  Black’s sketchy wall is easily deflated.  After b2, b4 on black’s center line would help to defend an invasion on the left.

Following through on your approach sequences establishes a solid rock base for future stones.

White jumped out from the right, black made some moves at the top, but the 3 and 4 spaces still hadn’t been adequately protected, so white invaded (behind the sector line).  The midpoint of the 3 space gap was the actual target, but the 4 space gap was the better starting point, as the Keima stone perhaps offered a cutting point.

![dia 8](images/l20250404/igo8.jpg)

Black had already made white strong on the side, so the peep was no threat.  Jumping out from the four stones was the safer, better move.

Pushing up to keep white separated perhaps works better than dropping down to threaten a cut.

![dia 12](images/l20250404/igo12.jpg)

W1 here looks good, but now the cut would be troublesome.

![dia 13](images/l20250404/igo13.jpg)

White connected solidly, so black got to play the connecting stone.  Therefore, white played the other midpoint - the original target.

Black might have gone for a counter Atari connection.

![dia 15](images/l20250404/igo15.jpg)

Black threatened to rescue his stones, but white ‘circled the wagons’, while being mindful of securing ample living space on the right.

Black threatened to rescue his stones, but white ‘circled the wagons’, while being mindful of securing ample living space on the right.

An interesting game today with lessons on not allowing large territories to form.

This is the way it ended.  Both players have large solid areas, but one area dominates.  Could we see this forming and could we do something about it?

A basic opening, except at the top I didn’t need my last extension, as I already had a stone at the midpoint.  However, I don’t play way and leave 2 three space vulnerabilities, but instead jump out to give depth to my position (which also stops black from jumping out there to give depth to his position), but also that depth reduces the risk of invasion.

We exchange extensions on the right, then black jumps out on the left to add depth and reduce the risk of an invasion of the 4 space gap.  White, of course, follows in order to add more depth by moving the sector line.  We can see large areas forming for white at the top and for black on the left.

Black has the option of reducing white, like jumping out from the right, or expanding himself on the bottom left.

B1 threatens white a bit, but not enough to keep white from taking black’s better move.  Now, white’s sector line has developed further.  If white has a large area, black could do the same by jumping out from the bottom left…or play in the center on white’s sector line.

Instead, black plays on the right, again threatening the 2 space extension.  Solidifying my position would be the basic move, but the right corner is a living group, so stopping black from jumping out on the left is a much bigger move.  Black does have another group growing, so expanding it would now be a smart move.

Jumping out on the left was good, but perhaps not as good as expanding the lower right.  White’s move is rather small, but it’s a calculated risk that black will respond locally and not expand elsewhere (the better move).

White expands the wall, but it’s vulnerable from the right where black should jump out.  White’s caps instead of protecting against the jump, as black’s area is still a threat (and a retreat would help one of my groups.

![dia 9](images/l20250307/igo9.jpg)

B1 doesn’t seem to help black or threaten white significantly. W2 jumps further into black’s potential pocket, then white retreats to the left.  Retreating up would only push black into white’s pocket.  Black still has a good jump from the right or from the left.

B1 was a gift, as I could ignore it and start to enclose my pocket.  Placing on the sector line is still an option for black, as he has stones to which he can retreat, working much like my capping stone.

Jumping out from the left was now too little, too late, as it helped me to close the gap.  At this point, black was down just 20 points, so a good end game could have kept it close.  Finding the right endgame moves found me another 30 points, that could have been black’s!

We need to be mindful of the opening, as it sets up the areas where conflict will happen.  We need to be mindful of expanding ourselves and reducing our opponent (doing both with the same stone is a bonus).  We need to be mindful of when to take Sente to start making the big endgame moves.

SB: Is expanding the lower right bigger because it would force a response there, so black expands his group and then can go back and defend the left? What if White doesn't respond to a move in the lower right and continues with an invasion on the left splitting blacks left side into 2 weaker groups?

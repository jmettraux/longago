A fantastic game from John today!  Not much to point out in his gameplay.

John approached my 3-4 first, so got the 3 space extension, but was up on the 4th line, so I could shoulder hit him from the 3rd line to get a 3 space extension for myself.  Equivalent situations at the bottom with our 4-4 stones.

John then invaded my right side.  B3 was a little odd, as the kick made me strong, then jumping out from it still leaves that group rather low.  This will allow white to jump out and split his two weakest groups.

I think jumping out immediately gets you into the center without putting any pressure on your group at the top.  R12 is still available to play, as a base later.  White’s group at the top is more vulnerable than black’s group, but white would also like to invade the left - tit for tat.

As expected, white came out, splitting the two groups and surrounding the top, which needed to secure eye space, basic Tsumego problem.  White has Sente.

White cuts off the stone that made the Atari earlier, then pushes out from the side, which gives black a wall.  Finally, white drops down to secure the corner and attack q2.

Having given black a wall, white jumps out to negate it.  Black follows, getting a narrow pocket.  Should black be thinking about jumping out from the left to negate the pocket white will hope to form?  A dog face at e6 looks good, as it also adds depth to the left side.

Before black can act on that, white invades.  White keeps it light, as the intention is just to reduce, so a dogface jump into the center gives the group flexibility as to where to go.

When black drops down, white keeps it light and just reaches back to connect with friends.  This is very different from the right side where white got a solidly connected corner defense and black got a clump of stones.  This would be an ideal time for that e6 dogface.

Instead, John pushes from the top (2 spaces from friends) which pushed white in the opposite direction.

![dia 10](images/l20241213/igo10.jpg)

Black comes out further into the center, as white defends at the top and dogfaces towards friends at the bottom to keep the invasion stones secure.  The final white stone here is just to exploit the initial 2 space distance between the black stones.  White is just going for a little forced reduction.

![dia 11](images/l20241213/igo11.jpg)

White ended up with more there than expected and ended with Sente, so got to put in a cornerstone for the box to secure more points in the center.

Although the gap has closed quite a bit, black might want to reduce the box white is forming at the bottom.


![dia 12](images/l20241213/igo12.jpg)

Black does a good job of pushing into the center to reduce white’s potential, but there is one too many moves in the circled 3 stones.  White has living groups on both sides, so disconnecting them doesn’t give black any leverage.  The leverage was pushing into the pocket, which white secures with the marked stone. That might be a 6 stone reduction mistake.

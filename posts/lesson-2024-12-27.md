In today’s game, I introduced the pincer, as we start to depart from our standard openings.  Connectivity is still important.  Lots of odd things will be thrown at us in a competitive game, but we need to use basic principles to find a way forward through the unfamiliar.

The first departure came by not playing 4-4 opposite John’s opening stone.  Next came an attachment instead of a kick to his low approach.

![dia 2](images/l20241227/igo2.jpg)

The upper right was a standard exchange, but in the lower right, the high approach was met with a high pincer.  I believe the black response is to attach under at r3 to start a fight for the corner.

![dia 3](images/l20241227/igo3.jpg)

Instead, black pincered the pincering stone, so white pincered it back.  Everything’s on the 4th line, so escape into the center is expected, but some attaching under (r3) can help.

In the jumping race to the center, b5 abandons b3, which immediately falls behind white’s sector line.

B1 doesn’t help the 2 black stones to stay connected.  A diagonal or one space jump has better connectivity.  W2 puts pressure on the other 2 black stones, as they are also behind white’s sector line.  Again, a diagonal or a one space jump will lead to a better result.

The Keima gets cut and the 3 black stones are adrift in a sea of white.

Strengthening the other side with b1, instead of extending towards the left, lets the 3 stones escape and puts pressure on white as it falls behind black’s sector line.

After realizing that there is no rescue, black plays away (to what must have looked like a big point to surround territory to compensate for the loss at the bottom center).  However, there is a lot of distance between those stones and ‘the two’ still aren’t connected.  A diagonal would put pressure on white and finally connect those two stones out.

![dia 9](images/l20241227/igo9.jpg)

First things first, for white, as there is one corner left to approach (and more territory can’t hurt).  However, instead of securing the top with another stone, white foolishly invades.  This move really shouldn’t get much traction and instead should help black to reduce the top.

![dia 10](images/l20241227/igo10.jpg)

One idea would be to let it run out with an idea to attack the top.

![dia 11](images/l20241227/igo11.jpg)

Attaching is like grabbing someone by the shoulder..you can expect them to easily break free (or break your arm).

![dia 12](images/l20241227/igo12.jpg)

White gets an eye and connects out, then switches to the right side where black still hasn’t connected out.

![dia 13](images/l20241227/igo13.jpg)

Again, the focus should be on staying connected, which is easy enough to do (still).

![dia 14](images/l20241227/igo14.jpg)

However, black played q9 (to support the side?), so that let the others get cut off.

![dia 15](images/l20241227/igo15.jpg)

Oh, here is that misstep.

There was still fight in that group as it dropped down to the bottom edge to try for life.  Very exciting, watch the video!

### Update 2024-12-28

I think this is the standard way of dealing with the corner when pincered.

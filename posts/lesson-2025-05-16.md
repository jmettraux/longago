White threw in a 3-3 rather than a slide to see what black would do.

![dia 2](images/l20250516/igo2.jpg)

W1 too played safe, as black can’t do anything, so an extension would have been much better.

![dia 3](images/l20250516/igo3.jpg)

The lower right corner was solidified, then black pushed along the edge to expand his bases.  B7 could also been at e4 to make the bottom pocket much bigger.  Also, on the right, after the kick of w10, standing would have been a solid continuation.

![dia 5](images/l20250516/igo5.jpg)

The diagonal to b7 by black seems misplaced, as white is running into black’s pocket.  Better to play where white wants to play (and did, ignoring b7).  Or not ignoring w2 and playing to expand the black group on the left.

![dia 6](images/l20250516/igo6.jpg)

Black makes a narrow(er) pocket in response to white’s jump, so white jumps north.  Black has a couple of choices to work with n10 or the chance to jump out from the left is still there.

![dia 7](images/l20250516/igo7.jpg)

Black gets a step behind by playing endgame moves at the top, so white threatens to cut the left in two.  The main purpose is to restrict black from coming in and get some points behind when white falls back.  Could black fight by pushing out into white’s loose connection?  Perhaps, but the two parts of black’s position would be weak on their own.

A safer play than pushing here would be as marked, but the cut looks like it might cause a bit of fun.

![dia 9](images/l20250516/igo9.jpg)

The two white stones are vulnerable, but does black want white to connect the last stone to the side?  White is looking at an avalanche, but an easy block for black.

![dia 10](images/l20250516/igo10.jpg)

White then decides to run the two stones out, but they are very vulnerable.  Could black leverage that vulnerability to push into the pocket?  B1 wants to connect back, so white fixes the vulnerability.

![dia 11](images/l20250516/igo11.jpg)

Black decides to connect and let white cut off the 4 stones at p10.

![dia 12](images/l20250516/igo12.jpg)

I expected black to fight.

![dia 13](images/l20250516/igo13.jpg)

We discussed this at the end of the stream, but John couldn’t see my screen.  H3 was just to complicate things and reduce a little.  Again, white expected black to fight back.

![dia 14](images/l20250516/igo14.jpg)

On the right, Black had a clever plan, that would have been thwarted by w1.

![dia 15](images/l20250516/igo15.jpg)

Instead, I pushed black to the side.  B1 should have sprung the trap, as soon as it became possible.

![dia 16](images/l20250516/igo16.jpg)

However, black pushed through at the top, which allowed white to take a stone for a safety valve.

![dia 17](images/l20250516/igo17.jpg)

If you allow your opponent enough time, they may forget where their safety valves are and fill them in.  That’s it for today!  Off to the mall with Yoshiko.

![dia 18](images/l20250516/igo18.jpg)

Anticipating reaction sequences can help you find places to play.  Here, white has said they want to jump into your area, so you block them.  They will then move into the open space, so you block them from that direction.Behind your blocks you are gaining profit, while they only move into the open.

![dia 19](images/l20250516/igo19.jpg)

Here black threatens the upper side, while deepening their pocket. B3 works with b1 to secure the top of the pocket, but also threatens to jump right.  When w4 jumps out to block, b5 takes a wide dogface position, because you want to be in front of the e6 stone.  W6 needs to jump out, so b7 starts to build the left side of black’s pocket.  The idea is to get your opponent to help you to build your area.

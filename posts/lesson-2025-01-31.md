## Lesson 2025-01-31

A good solid game today.  Of course, I have some observations.

![dia 1](images/l20250131/igo1.jpg)

John started by approaching my 4-4 corner, which I suggest leaving until after the 3-4 corner (due to the 4-4 can be approached from either side).  However, perhaps John wanted to influence my approach to his lower right corner.

![dia 2](images/l20250131/igo2.jpg)

Had he approached my 3-4 in the upper left first, the opening may have gone like this with  b19 taking the place of an extension (due to b7).

![dia 3](images/l20250131/igo3.jpg)

Had he approached the 4-4 first from the other side, the left side would have been tight for black, the top and bottom with four exploitable 3 space extensions, plus black gets his first post opening move on the right side.

![dia 4](images/l20250131/igo4.jpg)

However, we went with small groups everywhere (bottom and left side).  Black’s first move was this 1 space jump.  I prefer a keima to f7 due to the peep at q5.

![dia 5](images/l20250131/igo5.jpg)

The keima doesn’t leave a cutting point, plus you nose (b1) is in the open (reducing white’s potential and it would be defensive (loose sector line) against white intrusion into the gap on the right.

![dia 6](images/l20250131/igo6.jpg)

Black can get right side benefits, if cut, but white has better potential.

![dia 7](images/l20250131/igo7.jpg)

This shows the basic positional responses  (red and blue as 1, 2), although they weren’t always immediate, thus the sequence given in black.  White’s L5 was quite late in responding, so black could have taken advantage of that group.

![dia 8](images/l20250131/igo8.jpg)

Black was developing a huge pocket on the right, so white took up position on the sector line to reduce potential for development.  Black responses on the 3rd line with a 2 space and 3 space on either side.  If white wants to fight and push further in, there is a chance of being disruptive by attacking that stone, but also a risk due to black being on the 5th line on both sides.

![dia 9](images/l20250131/igo9.jpg)

An alternative would be to cap the white stone and make it run.  Black would need to have confidence that his positions on the sides would hold, since when white jumps into the right side black would need to respond from the opposite direction (white moves towards the bottom, black extends from the top or white moves towards the top, black extends from the bottom, to keep white from getting a base on the right side).

![dia 10](images/l20250131/igo10.jpg)

Instead of fighting, white goes to cut off the black stone, hoping to carve out some space in the center of the lower right quadrant - will it be enough compensation for black’s now strong right side?

![dia 11](images/l20250131/igo11.jpg)

What if b1 would have happened?  Black could use the cut black stone as leverage to solidify the right side then play off the sector line to ruin white’s potential.  Plus, the cut black stone still has aji, creating a cutting point if it extends out.  At the top, white has double 3 spaces, so they would also be exploitable to create something in the center.

![dia 12](images/l20250131/igo12.jpg)

When your opponent plays a keima close to your stones, you have to wonder if it can be cut (also if you play a keima!).  If b1, do you think white is going to w2, so you can push in with b3?  Remember the sequence with p9.

![dia 13](images/l20250131/igo13.jpg)

It’s more likely that white will block giving you a nice avenue after b7.

Remember, we want to push in one direction first in order to play in the opposite direction.

![dia 14](images/l20250131/igo14.jpg)

Black plays a non threatening move on the left, so white is free to jump in from the right or keima up.  White’s move creates territory behind it, while black’s move is purely directional (to link up two independently living groups?).

![dia 15](images/l20250131/igo15.jpg)

Black would go on to give white a huge center, but it was only enough to put white ahead by 12 points.  This is where having a good endgame is important.  Evaluating each move for ‘plus you, minus them’ can change the math significantly.

A good continuation for the corner sequences is the simple jump.

![dia 2](images/l20250418/igo2.jpg)

Instead, John took a position at the bottom, then jumped after white approached and played out the sequence.

![dia 3](images/l20250418/igo3.jpg)

If you’re going to play at the bottom, perhaps better to be the one pincering, rather than being pincered.

![dia 4](images/l20250418/igo4.jpg)

Usually, we’d just jump out again, but this move doesn’t give white a good counter move.

![dia 5](images/l20250418/igo5.jpg)

Pushing with f6 seemed about as good as anything, then black opened some doors.

![dia 6](images/l20250418/igo6.jpg)

Opening up that group’s presence in the center seems like a better idea.  Close fighting usually creates problems, while spreading out solves them.

![dia 7](images/l20250418/igo7.jpg)

White had the bamboo gate for connectivity, so making cutting points by pushing through the doors seemed appropriate.

![dia 8](images/l20250418/igo8.jpg)

Pushing through a bamboo gate is rather pointless, unless there is an immediate ’trick’ involved.  Here, black is going from 4 liberties to 3.

![dia 9](images/l20250418/igo9.jpg)

This is the appropriate sequence for white, but myopia is a common condition of Go players…

![dia 10](images/l20250418/igo10.jpg)

..which is why white only saw black in Atari and not himself…oops!

![dia 11](images/l20250418/igo11.jpg)

Black has a deficit at j4, if white wedges, but there is a better way.

![dia 12](images/l20250418/igo12.jpg)

A solid connection is also a threat, which white can’t ignore.

![dia 13](images/l20250418/igo13.jpg)

Since white has to respond, black can move out and start to threaten white’s other group.

![dia 14](images/l20250418/igo14.jpg)

Instead, black first made white’s weak group stronger by playing to solidify his own ‘living’ group, allowing white to jump first.  It was alive after h4, so everything else benefited white.

![dia 15](images/l20250418/igo15.jpg)

W2 solidifies white’s position and prevents black from coming out locally, however, black has other places to expand.

![dia 16](images/l20250418/igo16.jpg)

B1 was good, but after w2, b3 was a natural progression.  In the fight, after black jumped out from the right, black missed b1 as a way to protect a cut at q12.

![dia 17](images/l20250418/igo17.jpg)

Then after white cut and Atari, black connects at r15 to save a stone instead of b1 to expand his position.   If w2 takes, no worries!

Ok, that’s it for today.

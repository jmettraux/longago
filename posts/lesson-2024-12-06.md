## Lesson 2024-12-06

Unfortunately, another stream without audio.  Sorry for that, especially as John did a very good job of reduction.

![dia 1](images/l20241206/igo1.jpg)

Our corners were standard, except at the top, white’s 4-4 approach already had an extension (shared with the low extension of the other corner), so I could jump out, giving me a high stones to balance out the lower stones.  John also approached the 4-4 stone first, so committed to the left side before seeing how the other two corners would work out.  Perhaps, considering what would come next, approaching from the bottom would have been better.

![dia 2](images/l20241206/igo2.jpg)

Had the lower left corner been the 3rd corner approached, black could have approached from the bottom and not had to invade. W2 takes away the base, so black jumps out and w4 follows. On the right side, black has a 3 space, into a 3 space, into a 2 space, so relatively weak, yet he plays to the right, which should drive white to the right, towards his weakness.  Also, the right side has a stone on the 5th line, while on the left white is on the 3rd line.

Something like this first wouldn’t have weakened black’s stones on the left, while strengthening black’s basic position, so then he could have played at L7.

![dia 4](images/l20241206/igo4.jpg)

At this point, why wouldn’t you play on the right?  B1 is fairly aggressive,  while q7 would be more conservative and safer.  Black’s invading line had lots of options with the attachment being even safer now that b2 connected after the peep.

![dia 5](images/l20241206/igo5.jpg)

Of course, since it wasn’t protected, white invaded.  B1 is very odd.  I don’t see a reason for it.  If you’re giving up the 2 stones, there are better moves elsewhere on the board.  However, why give up the stones?

![dia 7](images/l20241206/igo7.jpg)

Here are 2 different ways to deal with a midpoint invasion.

![dia 8](images/l20241206/igo8.jpg)

When black jumps out from the right, we can see his plan.  White can get into and negate the center from the bottom.  From the top, getting into the center also means expanding white’s pocket.

![dia 9](images/l20241206/igo9.jpg)

White jumps from the bottom before black can close it off, then plays an odd move on the right.  It seems small, but it could negate the pocket, if not responded to.

![dia 10](images/l20241206/igo10.jpg)

White gets to erode black’s position a little, but black gets stronger and Sente with lots of good spots to play.  Expand yourself and restrict your opponent.

![dia 11](images/l20241206/igo11.jpg)

A huge waste of Sente on a safe position.

![dia 12](images/l20241206/igo12.jpg)

White plays more small eroding moves, then black jumps to a big point on the left.  It helps to protect the large space on the left side and threatens to jump out further.

![dia 13](images/l20241206/igo13.jpg)

White plays 2 forcing moves to establish a base for the Keima jump.  It’s a bit iffy, as black can counter by pushing into the pocket, but white feels connected enough to the bottom and so ‘t mind if the pocket gets negated.

![dia 14](images/l20241206/igo14.jpg)


White has a loose connection from top to bottom, but it hasn’t generated any profit.  It has given black solid territory on the left (where he already had almost solid territory), but most importantly it has disrupted black, so far, from getting a large pocket in the center.  Black could use anchor point for a center pocket, or push into the area lower left before white can create a pocket.  Black might even catch a few white stones, or disconnect  white’s string, making an attack on the top portion more severe.

![dia 15](images/l20241206/igo15.jpg)

Black attacks at an odd point and white connects (marked stones).  However, does get a 3rd wall for the left side of his pocket.  With Sente, white attacks the right side anchor.

![dia 16](images/l20241206/igo16.jpg)

White narrows black’s position with a solid wall, but black finds a good spot to close off his pocket which is also a good spot to jump into the open space above.

![dia 17](images/l20241206/igo17.jpg)

W1 is the correct impulse, but I quickly saw the elephant eye, so one space over would have been better.  B2 is a nice reducing move, which is easily blocked, but it has done its job.  Of course, black sees the elephant eye too, so white expects to get reduced some more.

![dia 18](images/l20241206/igo18.jpg)

![dia 18 XXX](images/l20241206/igo18b.jpg)

Instead of stepping back and taking a minor reduction, white pushes forward and offers alternatives. (1) block me and I block you/cut you off, (2) you push forward and I push forward too.

![dia 19](images/l20241206/igo19.jpg)

Here is an example of mutual negation, the question being who makes out better?

![dia 20](images/l20241206/igo20.jpg)

Blocking was probably the best answer.  That’s it for today.  Sorry about the lack of audio, but watch the video for the exciting conclusion.  John did an excellent job today, losing by less than 50 points.  Next week, both players will get their time reduced to 45 minutes ( which will affect Stephen more).
